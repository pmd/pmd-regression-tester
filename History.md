# 1.5.6-SNAPSHOT / ????-??-??

## New and Noteworthy

#### New Git default branch - "main"

We are joining the Git community and updating "master" to "main". Using the term "master" for the main
development branch can be offensive to some people. Existing versions of Git have been always capable of
working with any branch name and since 2.28.0 (July 2020) the default initial branch is configurable
(`init.defaultBranch`). Since October 2020, the default branch for new repositories on GitHub
is "main". Finally, PMD will also use this new name for the main branch in all our own repositories.

Note: The regression tester will also use branch `main` by default now for fetching repositories from the list of
projects. You might need to add `<tag>master</tag>` for some projects.

* As part of [#74](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-regression-tester/pull/74) runner now returns a single hash
  with the summarized values instead of multiple numbers:

```
summary = PmdTester::Runner.new(argv).run
puts summary
